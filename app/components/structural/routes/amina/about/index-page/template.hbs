          With over sixteen years of experience in design, Amina brings a mature perspective and wisdom born from the variety in her background. She has worked with three-person start-ups, mid-size family owned corporations, and billion-dollar public corporations. Amina focuses on new product development because she is at her best when her entrepreneurial spirit is engaged.
